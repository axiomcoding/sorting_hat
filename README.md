# Sorting Hat
Define a class, `House`, that passes each test in the RSpec file. There are 4 predefined instantiated objects in the RSpec file, `gryffindor`, `slytherin`, `hufflepuff`, and `ravenclaw`, each with attributes defined. These instances of the class will be called throughout the testing.  

Remember, *instance variables* (`@`) have a greater scope than local variables and can be used any any method throughout the `House` class!
